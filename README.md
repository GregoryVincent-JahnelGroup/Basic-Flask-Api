In order to test this code:

1. Download api.py and data.json
2. run python api.py
3. Run GET and POST requests in PostMan
You should be able to do both by either passing in a name in your GET request, or as part of the URL for a POST request.
In this form: /nameData/Name


Be sure to check the json file after you post. The purpose of the JSON file is just a persistent data store
to show the effect of a post request.
